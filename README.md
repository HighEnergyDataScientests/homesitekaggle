# Homesite Kaggle Competition
We are trying to create the best data model for the Homesite Kaggle competition.

To use the model, you need to download Anaconda flavor that meets your OS version from:

We are using python 3.5 for development. 

After that you need to download xgboost library and update all the libraries in your repo:

```
pip install xgboost

```
